Hi, I’m Sunil. 

I started this site for a simple reason: I recently became a dad. I wanted a space to document my work, my interests and stories, as well as the lessons I'm picking up along the way, so that one day I can share them with my son. And perhaps someone else might find value in them too.

My career hasn't followed a conventional straight line, and that’s been my greatest asset. 

I started out leading teams in the British Army, which included a large chunk of my 20s in the Middle East, navigating complex geopolitical landscapes. From there, I transitioned corporate life working on strategic initiatives at JPMorgan, earned my MBA at Oxford, and most recently co-founded a mission-driven maternity brand from the ground up with my wife. 

Moving between being a public servant, high-finance capitalist, and a startup founder has given me a unique perspective. Above all, it has taught me how to navigate ambiguity, build strong communities, and turn complex challenges into clear paths forward.

But there’s more to life than the resume. I believe in pushing boundaries and testing the limits of resilience. Whether it's completing in grueling multi-day ultras (like the Marathon des Sables) or cycling solo, unsupported from the UK to Beijing, I’ve found that the mental and physical adaptability you gain on endurance challenges is exactly what you need in life and leadership. 

Right now, I’m based in Leamington Spa, UK. I'm enjoying fatherhood, documenting my learnings here, and looking for my next great adventure (either physical or professional, but most likely the latter with a toddler in tow). 

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that sparks an idea, or at least, a good read.

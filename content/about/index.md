Hi, I’m Sunil.

I started this site for a pretty simple reason: I’ve just become a dad. I wanted a space to park my work, my interests, and the various lessons I’m picking up along the way, mostly so my son can look back at them one day. If anyone else finds a bit of value in these pages, that’s a bonus.

I’ve always seen life as a book. A series of chapters filled with unexpected twists and turns.

For a long time, my main motivation was simply to make the story as interesting as possible. I’ve been fortunate enough to travel to over 70 countries and have lived in both Eastern Europe and the Middle East. Whether it was leading teams in the British Army during my 20s or cycling solo and unsupported from the UK to Beijing, I’ve lived by a fairly simple mantra: make a positive impact where I can and live the most interesting life possible.

That drive to do *difficult and different* things used to be about what the story looked like when all was said and done. Now that I’m a father, the motivation has shifted. It’s less about the external "plot" and more about becoming the best version of myself for him and my family.

A massive part of my story, however, has always been a deep-seated love for technology. I’m a tech nerd at heart, and that’s been the common thread through every chapter. In the military, that meant diving into the weeds of radio and satellite communications. Later, I backed that practical experience with a Computer Science background and eventually moved into the strategy side of a blockchain start-up.

I still spend a lot of my time down the *deep tech* rabbit hole. I’m particularly love applying frontier tech to different industries. Such as exploring the intersection of blockchain and AI/ML, or computer vision in fashion, or using data science to better understand national energy policy to name a few. This website is partly my digital sandbox; a place to share those technical deep dives alongside more personal stories and insights.

I’m currently based in the UK. Between fatherhood, entrepreneurship, and documenting my projects here, I’m always on the lookout for my next big adventure (physical or metaphorical), though "adventure" these days is usually dictated by a nap schedule.

Thanks for stopping by. I hope you find something here that sparks an idea, or at least, a good read.
